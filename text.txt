In this project we will be creating an encryption and decryption
logic within a module that access two packages, the decrypt and encrypt package.When we are done we will publish this module.
The encrpytion algorithm basically adds 3 to each character as a
key code, e.g A = D, M = P etc.
module: cryptit
package 1: encrypt
package 2: decrypt
